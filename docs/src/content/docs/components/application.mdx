At the core of every NaN application stands `NaN\App`.
It is a PSR-15-compatible request handler with support for services and middleware.
Upon running the application, all request data will be passed on to the middleware in exchange for a response.
The response will, therefrom, be processed to  be sent to the client.

```php title="index.php"
use NaN\App;

$app = new App();

$app->run();
```

### Services

Services can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.
It will accept any PSR-11-compatible containers.

```php
use NaN\DI\Container;

$app = new App(new Container([
	CustomServiceInterface::class => CustomService::class,
]));
```

Services can also be later registered through the array-access operator.
For this to work the service container that was provided in the `App` constructor must allow registration through array-access operators.

```php
$app[CustomServiceInterface::class] = CustomService::class;
```

If the service container is incompatible, a warning will be triggered.
You'll have to register your services through other means or stick to the NaN DI container.

##### Retrieving services

An instance of the service can be retrieved through the same array-access operator.

```php
$custom_service = $app[CustomService::class];
```

These services will be available only on an application level (or wherever the `Container` instance is used).
As such, the dependencies injected into the routes will come from the `App` instance that manages the route.
Any service you want access to from your routes should be registered through the NaN application instance.

### Middleware

Middleware can be conveniently and optionally registered through the `NaN\App` constructor.
It will accept any PSR-15-compatible request handlers.
If the middleware container is also PSR-11 compatible, it will be added as a delegate to the services container.

```php
use NaN\App\Middleware;
use NaN\App\Middleware\Router;

$router = new Router();

$app = new App($services, new Middleware([
	Router::class => $router,
]));
```

Middleware can also be later registered through the traditional `use` method.
For this to work the middleware container that was provided in the `App` constructor must allow registration through array-access operators.

```php
$app->use($middleware);
```

If the middleware container is incompatible, a warning will be triggered.
You'll have to register your middleware through other means or stick to the NaN middleware container.

##### Sharing data between middleware

The main purpose for providing container support through the NaN App is for sharing data between middleware.
Indeed, to use the NaN App's container for any other reason seems redundant.
